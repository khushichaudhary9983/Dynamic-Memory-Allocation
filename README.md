# 🖥️ Terminal Website System in C

This is a basic "Website-style" project made in **C language**. It runs in the terminal and simulates a simple **Register and Login system**, just like you'd find on a real website — but all in the terminal!

It uses **dynamic memory allocation** and **file storage** to manage users.

## 📦 How It Works

When you run the program, you'll see a menu like this:


- If you choose **Register**, you can enter your name, email, and password.
- This info is saved in a text file (`users.txt`) on your computer.
- If you choose **Login**, it checks that your email and password match what’s in the file.
- If it matches, it welcomes you! 🎉
